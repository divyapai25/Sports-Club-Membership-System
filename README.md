# Sports-Club-Membership-System
A demo project developed as part of the curriculum - Distributed Databases during my bachelor's. It is a desktop application that:-
1. Allows members to register themselves in the Sports Club
2. The Admin can have an access to the database and view, delete and update the records as per his/her need
3. Developed using Microsoft Visual Studio
4. MySQL is used to handle data and perform all the insert, delete, update and select commands.
